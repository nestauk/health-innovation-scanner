# health-innovation-scanner
Mapping health innovation globally for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.


## Who are we?

We are Chantale Tippet (researcher), George Richardson (data scientist) and Kostas Stathoulopoulos (data scientist). We work on the Health Innovation Scanner as part of the [Innovation Mapping](https://www.nesta.org.uk/project/innovation-mapping/) team at [Nesta](https://www.nesta.org.uk/). We are team of data scientists, engineers, visualisers and researchers exploring the use of new data sources, data science methods and interactive visualisations to inform decisions about innovation and research in government and civil society.

The scanner is an application we are developing in collaboration with the [Robert Wood Johnson Foundation](https://www.rwjf.org/) (RWJF), a philanthropic organisation focusing on health, and Nesta's [Health Lab](https://www.nesta.org.uk/project/health-lab/). This project began when RWJF decided that to fund the best health innovations, they needed to expand their search globally and to find new technologies and practices.
