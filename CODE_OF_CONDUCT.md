# Code of Conduct
## Participation Guidelines
This project, funded by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and participating in Mozilla’s Open Leaders mentorship programme (Cohort 7), respects Mozilla's community participation guidelines. These guidelines govern the behaviour of everyone who is involved in the Health Innovation Scanner at any capacity.

## How to treat each other
* Be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Do not threaten violence
* Empower others
* Strive for excellence
* Don’t expect to agree with every decision

## Inclusion and Diversity
Our project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

Every project related activity should be inclusive and should support such diversity.

## Violation of the Code of Conduct
Members of the community who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed to the project, or how specialised their skill set - will be approached by a member of the leadership team. If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with the leadership team the contributor will be asked to discontinue his/her participation in the project.
