## How to start contributing today:

* Let us know about other people/organisations working in the health innovation space who we can speak to (to collaborate, make sure we’re not duplicating efforts, etc.)

* Start a buzz! Promote the project through social media (e.g. LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook)!
* Suggest new data sources or features we should think about including in future development. This could include packages to collect data and pull requests. You can log them [here](https://github.com/nestauk/health-innovation-scanner/issues/13)!
