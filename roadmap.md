# Roadmap

## Project Mission and Summary

We are working with members of the health community globally to develop an open, online platform that can be used to explore innovations in health research, as well as activity in startups, apps and social ventures across the world. We are working openly because this will allow others with the goal of improving health in own their communities to validate, replicate, or build on our work.

## Milestones (short and medium-term)

### 1. First ‘analytic’ output produced (mid-April 2019)
* Use the platform to analyse research on bowel cancer for a workshop.
* Write up a short blog on findings.
* Present these findings at [Health Lab](https://www.nesta.org.uk/project/health-lab/) workshop on 11 April.


### 2. First prototype tested by users (end-April 2019)
* Choose platform and tools for user testing.
* Finalise user testing protocol.
* Select group of testers.
* Complete development of the first prototype.
* Deploy to users.

### 3. Minimum Viable Product launched (20 June 2019)
* Develop and test the search functionality of the Health Innovation Scanner.
