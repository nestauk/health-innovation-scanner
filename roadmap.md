# Roadmap

## Project Mission and Summary

We are working with members of the health community globally to develop an open, online platform that can be used to explore innovations in health research, as well as activity in startups, apps and social ventures across the world. We are working openly because this will allow others with the goal of improving health in own their communities to validate, replicate, or build on our work.

* Continue recuiting for external user testers 
* Ask external users to provide feedback on wireframe 

### 2. First prototype tested by users (mid-May to June 2019)
* Finalise user testing protocol
* Select group of testers
* Complete development of the first prototype
* Deploy to users

### 3. Minimum Viable Product launched (mid-July 2019)
